* Turing Drawings with Processing and Arduino
Final project for UCSB Art 122 (Spring 2013) by Kasper Primdal Lauritzen.

** Abstract

** Background
The idea for the project came from [[http://maximecb.github.io/Turing-Drawings/][Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert]]s
website, where a simple Turing Drawing generator lets you see a quick
simulation of random rules.

Another inspiration is Stephen Wolfram's /A New Kind of Science/ [1]. Here the simplest rules, Cellular Automata, are described and explored (esp. chapter 3). 
** Goals
The goal is to let the audience explore the patterns and flows that simple
rules can create. 
** Implementation
